      <p>
        The opposite of a number. It can be thought of as the result of a unary operator that
        negates the number. The sum of a number and its additive inverse is zero. This can also be
        described as the negation of a number (or unary minus) and the opposite of a number.

        <h3>Examples</h3>
        <p>
          The additive inverse of {"`7`"} is {"`-7`"}.
        </p>
        <p>
          The opposite of {"`-3`"} is {"`3`"}.
        </p>
        <p>
          {"`1`"} is the negation of {"`-1`"}.

        <h3>Properties</h3>
        <p>
          <i>double-negative property:</i> negating a negative number results in a positive number,
          i.e., {"$$-(-x) = x$$"}
